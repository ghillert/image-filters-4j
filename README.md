Image Processing Filters for Java

I did not see any Mavenized version of Jerry Huxtable's **Java Image Processing Classes**.

This repo contains all classes as available via the download at:

http://www.jhlabs.com/ip/filters/download.html

The goal is to have the filters available via the Maven Central repository eventually.
